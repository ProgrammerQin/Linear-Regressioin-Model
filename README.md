# Linear-Regressioin-Model
There are 6 sample points as shown in following figure. 
X stands for independent variable, and Y stands for dependent variable. 
It is known that:
p1 = {12, 21}; p2 = {20, 40}; p3 = {25, 9}; 
p4 = {36, 18}; p5 = {40, 60}; p6 = {50, 61} 

Assume that a linear regression model will be built to fit these data points. 

Question 1:
Solve the optimized values of 𝛉0 and 𝛉1 of the linear regression model. 
Write the answer in following space:

Question 2:
What is the predicted value of p5? 
Write the answer in following space:

Question 3:
How much of the Mean Squared Error? 
Write the answer in following space:


Question 4:
If there is new data point whose independent value X is 60, please predict its dependent value. 
Write the answer in following space:
